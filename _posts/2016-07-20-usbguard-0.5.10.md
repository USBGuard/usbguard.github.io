Good news everyone! A new release of USBGuard is finally available. As usual there are many bugfixes, several new features and some other changes.
USBGuard has gotten a D-Bus component so the integration possibilities are endless now :D The usbguard-applet-qt subproject was merged into the main
project repository. Thanks to that it will hopefully receive more love in the near future. One of the more important bugfixes delivered by this
release is the rewrite of the USB descriptor parsing code which previously didn't work correctly for many devices.

It seems that the community around the project is growing. There is an effort to package the project for [Debian](https://lists.debian.org/debian-mentors/2016/05/msg00639.html)
and so far it resulted in many improvements in the upstream code and workflows.

## Major changes

 * Changed versioning scheme to include a release number. Releases will be rolled out more often during a milestone (x.y -- currently 0.5) development.
 * Merged usbguard-applet-qt (sub)project into usbguard.
 * Added a D-Bus bridge component which exposes a D-Bus interface to usbguard.
 * Enhancements of the usbguard command-line interface.
 * Fixed USB descriptor data parsing. Previously, many real-world cases of descriptors weren't parsed correctly because of a naive implementation of the parser.
 * Fixed systemd integration.
 * Manual pages are now generated from their source (markdown) during the build process.
 * A default usbguard-daemon configuration file is now installed.
 * Fixed issues: #84, #83, #80, #79, #78, #77, #76, #75, #74, #73, #72, #71, #70, #69, #68, #56, #54, #53, #51, #50, #44.
