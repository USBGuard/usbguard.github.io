# New release: usbguard-0.7.6, and important projects updates again!

A new release of USBGuard is available and it brings important bug fixes and new features. See the [release page](https://github.com/USBGuard/usbguard/releases/tag/usbguard-0.7.6 "release page") at Github for more information about the release.

Now the important projects updates I would like to announce:
1. Unfortunately, I made a mistake in git workflow thus the release has not a verified sign next to release 0.7.6.
2. The proof-of-concept Qt applet was substituted with a brand new project called [usbguard-notifier](https://github.com/Cropi/usbguard-notifier).

# Change Log
## Added

- Added missing options in manpage usbguard-daemon(8)
- Extended the functionality of allow/block/reject commands the command can handle rule as a param and not only its ID e.g. in case of allow, command will allow each device that matches provided rule
- Added debug info for malformed descriptors

## Fixed/Changed

- Changed default backend to uevent
- Fixed handling of add uevents during scanning now we are sure that the enumeration is completed before processing any uevent we are trying to avoid a race where the kernel is still enumerating the devices and send the uevent while the parent is being authorised
- Silenced 'bind' and 'unbind' uevents
